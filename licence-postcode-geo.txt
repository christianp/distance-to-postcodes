Our postcode products (derived from Code-Point(R) Open) are subject to the Open Government Licence and the Ordnance Survey OpenData Licence.

If you also use the Northern Ireland data (postcodes starting with "BT"), you need a separate licence for commercial use direct from Land and Property Services. We only issue a Northern Ireland End User Licence (for internal business use only) with the data. To download a copy, go to the "Download" section of this page. Use of the Northern Ireland data contained within the ONS postcode products constitutes acceptance of the Northern Ireland licensing terms and conditions.
